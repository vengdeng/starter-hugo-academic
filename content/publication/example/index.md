abstract: We present an end-to-end trainable Neural Net- work architecture for
  stereo imaging that jointly locates and estimates human body poses in 3D. Our
  method defines a 2D pose for each human in a stereo pair of images and uses a
  correlation layer with a composite field to associate each left-right pair of
  joints. In absence of a stereo pose dataset, we show that we can train our
  method with synthetic data only and test it on real-world images (i.e., our
  training stage is domain invariant). Our method is particularly suitable for
  autonomous vehicles. We achieve state-of-the-art results for the 3D
  localization task on the challenging real-world KITTI dataset while running
  four times faster.
